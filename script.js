// block -> A block is a set of opening and closing curly brackets.

// var -> can be reassigned and are only available inside the function they're created in. Its function scoped.

// const -> cannot be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code. Its block scoped.

// let -> It can be reassigned but its similar to const i.e block scoped.
//        If variables are not crreated inside a function or block they are globally scoped.
